# Forkify App

Welcome to Forkify App! Forkify is a web application designed to make cooking and meal planning easier and more enjoyable. With Forkify, users can explore a vast collection of recipes for various dishes, ranging from breakfast to dessert. Whether you're looking for a quick and easy weeknight dinner recipe or a special treat for a special occasion, Forkify has you covered.

This project was created for educational purposes by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman) on the Udemy platform as part of "The Complete JavaScript Course 2024: From Zero to Expert!" course, and implemented by me. I also added some modern features to make this application more user-friendly and enhance the overall experience.

Happy Cooking!

## Features

- **Discover Recipes**: Forkify allows users to search for recipes by entering keywords or ingredients. The application provides a user-friendly interface for browsing through a wide selection of recipes sourced from reputable cooking websites and blogs.
- **Manage Bookmarks**: Users can bookmark their favorite recipes to save them for later. Bookmarked recipes are easily accessible from the user's profile, making it convenient to revisit and cook them again.
- **Update Servings**: One of the unique features of Forkify is the ability to adjust serving sizes for recipes. Users can easily scale recipes up or down to accommodate different serving sizes or the number of guests they're cooking for. The application automatically recalculates ingredient quantities to ensure accurate measurements for the desired number of servings.
- **Create Custom Recipes**: In addition to exploring existing recipes, users can create and upload their own recipes to share with the Forkify community. This feature allows users to showcase their culinary creations and contribute to the ever-growing recipe database.
- **Interactive Cooking Experience**: Forkify provides step-by-step cooking instructions, along with helpful tips and tricks, to guide users through the cooking process. The interactive interface makes it easy to follow along with each recipe, ensuring successful results every time..
